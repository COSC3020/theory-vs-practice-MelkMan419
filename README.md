# Theory vs. Practice

- List 3 reasons why asymptotic analysis may be misleading with respect to
  actual performance in practice.
  1. Constants in smaller input sized could affect it in practice.
  2. The way data is actually disributed throughout the set
  3. Memory fetching 

- Suppose finding a particular element in a binary search tree with 1,000
  elements takes 5 seconds. Given what you know about the asymptotic complexity
  of search in a binary search tree, how long would you guess finding the same
  element in a search tree with 10,000 elements takes? Explain your reasoning.
  Sinec we know that a binary search tree typically has a time complexity of O(log n), with te increase I think it would be a good assumption of it now taking between 6 and 7 seconds.

- You measure the time with 10,000 elements and it takes 100 seconds! List 3
  reasons why this could be the case, given that reasoning with the asymptotic
  complexity suggests a different time.
  1. An unbalanced tree
  2. Awkward data distribution
  3. Poor memory accessing implementations
